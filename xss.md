## types
### Stored (Persistent) 
XSS 	The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)

## Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS 	
Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)


## DOM-based XSS 	Another Non-Persistent 
XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags)
